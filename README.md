# ActiveRecordLite
This is meant to be a skeleton some of the basics of ActiveRecord in the hopes of understanding it better myself as well as possibly helping others.

Technologies:
[activesupport gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/activesupport/versions/5.0.0)
[sqlite3](https://www.sqlite.org/)

Background:
[ActiveRecord](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

This skeleton covers:
* Ruby metaprogramming
* SQLObjects
* Database setup
* Searchability
* Writing your own getters and setters
* Associations (belongs_to, has_many, has_many_through)
